# Assignment 1 — Dieter Rams’ Ten Principles for Good Design

Your task is to create a web site of Dieter Rams’s design principles. All ten are included in the accompanying file `ten-principles-for-good-design.txt`. You’re free to create a single page site containing all ten rules or a ten-page site.

The content of your project must consist of the contents in the file `ten-principles-for-good-design.txt` and the content required for a navigation system. **No other content is allowed.**

## The Rules

- You must use two typefaces. Look to [`https://fonts.google.com/`](https://fonts.google.com/) for ideas.
- You must use three colors. Look to [`https://color.adobe.com/`](https://color.adobe.com/) for ideas.
- Your HTML code must validate. Use either [`http://html5.validator.nu/`](http://html5.validator.nu/) or [`http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input`](http://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).
- Your CSS must validate. Use [`https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input`](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).
- Your site’s UI must be logical, clear, and easy to use.
- Your HTML and CSS must be neat and easy to read.
- You must put your project on GitHub.
- There must be no character set conflicts.

## Due

This assignment is due by 7:59 AM on Sunday, 6 November 2016.

## Project Scaffold

There’s a folder called `site` included in this assignment’s folder structure. It contains some starter files for you to work with. In the `title` element of `index.html`, replace `PUT YOUR NAME HERE` with your name and `PUT YOUR GIHUB USERNAME HERE` with your GitHub username.

Any images you might use should be placed in the `img` folder. All your CSS must go in the `style.css` file in the `css` folder, and some or all of your HTML, depending on the final project scaffold you choose, must go in the `index.html` file.

## Submission

You will be submitting this assignment via GitHub, but not via my account. Instead, you will publish this assignment to your own GitHub account and I will fork it by the due date.

We’ll discuss in class on Saturday, 29 October 2016, how to easily put your project on GitHub.
